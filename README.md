# What is pglift?

pglift is a solution aiming at deploying production-ready instances of
PostgreSQL, set up, backed up and monitored.

Here, the term "instance" means a plain PostgreSQL instance (aka a cluster)
complemented with satellite services which are essential to ensure proper
operation in a production context. These satellite components typically
concern backup, monitoring, high-availability or migration.

The project aims at supporting several tools for each category. At the moment,
supported tools are:

* Backup: [pgBackRest][]
* Monitoring & insights: [Prometheus postgres\_exporter][], [temBoard][],
  [PoWA][]

[pgBackRest]: https://pgbackrest.org/
[Prometheus postgres\_exporter]: https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter
[temBoard]: https://temboard.readthedocs.io/
[PoWA]: https://temboard.readthedocs.io/
