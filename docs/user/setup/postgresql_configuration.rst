PostgreSQL configuration
========================

Instances created by pglift have their configuration managed. This is handled
by writing these configuration items into specific files located in the
``conf.pglift.d`` directory within instance's data directory. An include
directive is then inserted on top of main ``postgresql.conf`` file.

For instance, given a ``13/main`` instance, we'll have the following
configuration tree:

.. code-block:: bash

    $prefix/srv/pgsql/13/main/data/
    ├── conf.pglift.d
    │   ├── pgbackrest.conf
    │   ├── site.conf
    │   └── user.conf
    ├── postgresql.auto.conf
    └── postgresql.conf

Head of ``postgresql.conf`` contains:

.. code-block::
   :caption: postgresql.conf

    include_dir = 'conf.pglift.d'

    # -----------------------------
    # PostgreSQL configuration file
    # -----------------------------
    #


File ``conf.pglift.d/user.conf`` contains configuration items defined by the
user at instance creation or update.

File ``conf.pglift.d/site.conf`` contains site-wise configuration items, if
any. (That is, configuration defined at distribution step.)

File ``conf.pglift.d/pgbackrest.conf`` contains configuration items needed for
pgBackRest to operate. Any other satellite service needing to override
PostgreSQL configuration would have its file there.

Since the include directive is located on top of ``postgresql.conf`` file, any
setting defined in that file (and kept after the include directive) will take
precedence over the managed configuration.
